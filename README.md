Mini Metro Reinforcement Learning Agent

Mini metro is a popular metro planning game. The goal is to connect stations with lines and assign locomotives to these lines so that no station is overcrowed within a time window. I started playing this game and wondered if computers can do better than humans. So I wrote this simulator to test my hypothesis.
